# ev.energy mobile app tech test

## [instructions](https://ev-energy.notion.site/Mobile-Engineer-tech-test-2aef31071f4f450f8b330749b26ed350)


This app was generated using `npx create-expo-app --template` and specifying the 'blank app with TS enabled'. Further screens, components, styling and navigation was added by myself. 


### Commands
- `npx expo start` will start the dev server. From here you are able to launch the app using your mobile device or in a simulator.
